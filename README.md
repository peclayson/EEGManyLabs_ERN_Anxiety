# EEGManyLabs_ERN_Anxiety

This repo holds the sripts for data processing for the #EEGManyLabs replication study (see [here](https://osf.io/6suf8/)) of the ERN-anxiety relationship. This code was uploaded with the Stage 1 Registered Report, and it will be updated with the submission of the Stage 2 Report.

Information on how to use the scripts is contained in [ReadMe.pdf](https://github.com/peclayson/EEGManyLabs_ERN_Anxiety/blob/main/ReadMe.pdf).

## Side note

Bill Gehring provided the `gratton_emcp.m` script, which is a MATLAB implementation of the Miller, Yee, and Gratton C code. That C code is also shared here in `emcp2001.zip`. These resources are shared here with his permission. Please feel free to use them in your own work.
