# EEGManyLabs_ERN_Anxiety

This repo holds the sripts for data processing for the #EEGManyLabs replication study (see [here](https://osf.io/6suf8/)) of the ERN-anxiety relationship. This code was uploaded with the Stage 1 Registered Report, and it will be updated with the submission of the Stage 2 Report.

Information on how to use the scripts is contained in [ReadMe.pdf](https://github.com/peclayson/EEGManyLabs_ERN_Anxiety/blob/main/ReadMe.pdf).
